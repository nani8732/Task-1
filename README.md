This Python script is a CLI Calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations â€” addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It uses separate functions for each operation and runs in a loop, repeatedly asking the user to select an operation and input two numbers. It includes input validation and handles division by zero. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit by selecting option 5.
